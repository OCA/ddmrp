Allow to extend DDMRP App to be able to apply Adjustments for dynamically
altering buffers for planned or anticipated events. This include:

* **Demand Adjustment Factor (DAF)**: is a manipulation of the ADU input
  within a specific time period. The system will look for existing DAFs when
  computing the ADU for each buffer and apply them. The system will also
  explode the resulting increase in demand of parent buffers to all their
  children buffers using the BoM.
* **Lead Time Adjustment Factor (LTAF)**: manipulates the Decoupled Lead Time
  for an individual part or group of parts (buffer profile, same partner...)
  to adjust for a planned or known expansions of LT.
* Zone Adjustment Factor (ZAF): pending to implement
