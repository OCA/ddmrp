Allow to extend DDMRP App to be able to apply Adjustments for dynamically
altering buffers for planned or anticipated events. This include:

* **Demand Adjustment Factor (DAF)**: is a manipulation of the ADU input
  within a specific time period. The system will look for existing DAFs when
  computing the ADU for each buffer and apply them. The system will also
  explode the resulting increase in demand of parent buffers to all their
  children buffers using the BoM.
* **Lead Time Adjustment Factor (LTAF)**: manipulates the Decoupled Lead Time
  for an individual part or group of parts (buffer profile, same partner...)
  to adjust for a planned or known expansions of LT.
* Zone Adjustment Factor (ZAF): pending to implement

Usage
=====

To plan buffer adjustments act as follows:

#. Click on *Inventory > Demand Planning > Create Buffer Adjustments*.
#. In the popup window fill the *Period* and *Date Range Type* to perform
   your planning.
#. Check the boxes of the *Factor to Apply* in which you are interested.
#. Select the DDMRP Buffers where to apply this factors.
#. Under the title *Sheet* you will see a generated sheet in which you can
   fill the values for each period.
#. Click *Validate* to confirm your planning and the system will end up
   showing you the newly created DDMRP adjustment records.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Implement new factors
* Reuse existing factor and modify them instead of always creating new ones.
* Add small graph view in buffer form as a way to overview DAFs.
