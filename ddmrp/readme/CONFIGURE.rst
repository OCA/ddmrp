Decoupled Lead Time computation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DLT is automatically computed by the system.

For manufactured products' buffers just remember to provide and
set properly the following information:

* The *Manufacturing Lead Time* for the manufactured product. It can be found
  at the product form view under the tab *Sales*.
* The *Delivery Lead Time* for the preferred vendor of a product. This is
  important for the products which are purchased and are components in any
  Bill of Materials.

For purchased/distributed products' buffers the logic is simpler.

* In the first place the system will look if there are Vendors for the product,
  if so it will use the *Delivery Lead Time* of the preferred one.
* In case of absence of vendors, the *Lead Time* at the bottom of the Buffer
  form view will be used.
